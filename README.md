## Code

This repo contains the R Markdown file used to generate the pre-analytical turnaround time dashboard that was presented in the R workshop session at AACC 2019, and an example configuration file to store database connection information. Note that this is only an example file and the Rmd file cannot be knit into a html since specific database credentials are required. Both files are included in the src directory.
